## Planned Topics

- [ ] Project layout -- flat vs layered, `cmd/` and `internal/`
- [ ] Clean architecture -- separating domain, handlers, storage
- [ ] Configuration management -- env vars, config files, 12-factor
- [ ] Logging strategy -- structured logging, log levels
- [ ] Health checks -- liveness, readiness endpoints
- [ ] Database patterns -- connection pooling, repository pattern
- [ ] Caching -- in-memory, Redis patterns
- [ ] Message queues -- producer/consumer patterns
- [ ] Circuit breakers -- protecting downstream services
- [ ] Observability -- metrics, tracing, logging triangle
