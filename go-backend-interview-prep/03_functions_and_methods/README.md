# 03 -- Functions and Methods

How Go defines behavior and attaches it to types.

---

## Planned Topics

- [ ] Functions -- signatures, multiple return values, named returns
- [ ] Variadic functions -- `...` syntax, passing slices
- [ ] Closures -- anonymous functions, capturing variables
- [ ] Recursion -- base case patterns, stack considerations
- [ ] Methods -- value receivers vs pointer receivers
- [ ] Method sets -- which receiver type satisfies which interface
- [ ] Defer -- LIFO order, deferred cleanup, common pitfalls
- [ ] Init functions -- `func init()`, execution order
